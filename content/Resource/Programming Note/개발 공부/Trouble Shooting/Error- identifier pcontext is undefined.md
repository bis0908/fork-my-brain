> [!info] [RESOLVED] PCONTEXT undefined  
> I don't use C++ often, so probably doing everything wrong ... :blush: I'm trying to use some simple functions found on the forum. Getting some errors about * LONG being undefined, so included * FILETIME being undefined, so included ... Now PCONTEXT is undefined (in WinBase.h line typedef PCONTEXT LPCONTEXT;) and I don't know where to get it's definition.
